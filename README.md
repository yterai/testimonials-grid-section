## Overview

Create a testimonials grid section aiming to practice CSS grid and the mobile-first approach.

### The challenge

To create the grid layout for desktop size - I needed to apply the CSS grid concept well.

## My process

- Style mobile size first (less than 1023px)
- Add only one break point for responsive (more than 1024px) and apply the styling accordingly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used CSS grid for some projects before but it's been pretty rusty and I needed to brush up on it. I've learned how the grid properties work and when I should use them. This is pretty basic but it would help me to troubleshoot when it comes to CSS gird used websites.

### Continued development

I tried to do a mobile first approach in the previous project but I wasn't completely sure of the meaning of moblie first and how to implement it. I challenged myself to do it again in this project and I would say I feel more confident to make a mobile first website now.
